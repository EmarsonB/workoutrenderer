## 🎯 Steps taken to fulfill requirements & Discussion.

1. 📁 Folder structure is simplified. Components used was stored in the components folder
   2 🗄 Card.tsx
   3 📓 This component served as the Fitness Card which was re-used with the data given. This is where the attributes in the data were stored and displayed. Also, dynamic colors and stylings was implemented.
   4 🗄 CardWrapper.tsx
   5 📓 This componet handles the outer container for the segments. As the container, it only wrapped the Card component with the header name.
2. 🧠 I have noticed in the given data that there was a pattern for the array. This is where reusability came into place. I have utilized the pattern to achieve re-usability.
